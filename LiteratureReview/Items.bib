	abstract = {It is well known that a strong relationship exists between national expenditures on health care and national income. This has been used to suggest that health care is a luxury good, and that factors such as the type of health care delivery system in a country are of little importance in determining expenditure levels. This paper argues that these implications rely upon the application of microeconomic analysis to macroeconomic data, and that this is not appropriate. As well as raising questions about the inferences drawn from previous studies, new empirical evidence is presented which casts some doubts on previous findings. International comparisons are based on Purchasing Power Parity rather than exchange rate conversions, underlining the importance of prices as well as quantities in the relationship, and leading to the conclusion that the aggregate data show health care to be, if anything, a necessity rather than a luxury good.},

	title = {Health and the developing world.},
	abstract = {This book originated from a collaborative study initiated jointly by the Rockefeller Foundation and the U.S. Agency for International Development and carried out by a team of which the author was a member and a rapporteur.
In the foreword to the book, Dr. John {WEIR}, of the Rockefeller Foundation, points out that the aim of this study carried out in several countries within a wide cultural range (e.g. Colombia, Jamaica, Malawi, Senegal, Thailand) was to collect some background information and to provide guidelines for health planners.
The book starts with a few touching case studies of persons caught up in the vicious net of poverty, ignorance and disease in tropical countries.
It then shows the diversity of health problems on a world scale in relation to various stages of socioeconomic development and reviews the ways in which these problems are (or are not!) being solved. A number of statistical data quoted in this part of the book are revealing and indicate the care with which the relevant information has been collected.
The chapter on the role of health in the process of development dwells on the increased survival of people and on the phenomenon of population growth; it also discusses the conflict between needs and resources of national health planning.
The author deals with the concept of the health team and its functions and this leads to the consideration of the pattern of education at all levels of medical care in developing countries and to the part to be played by international and other organizations.
The final thoughtful chapter considers many facets of the dilemma of how to provide effective health care for all the members of societies in the painful transitional period of social and economic imbalance due to limited resources.
In the long chain of concepts, techniques, decisions and events that influence social advance there are many weak links and the author, while unable to offer any ready recipes, courageously and eloquently states the case and searches for possible answers. He believes that a better understanding of the new role and increased responsibility of medical auxiliaries, an improved system of management and a revised type of professional training may speed up the solution of some most pressing health problems which are the symptoms of the present perplexing and dangerous phase in human history.
The text is a happy blend of meaningful communication, of factual data and of compassionate and compellingly expressed awareness of human needs. The book is well-produced and charmingly illustrated by hand-printed linocuts of a Thai artist.
This book is of exceptional interest, not only to the medical profession, but also to all economists, sociologists, administrators and politicians concerned with the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor nations. It shows how, in spite of phenomenal technical advances of medical science, we are unable to provide the simplest measures of health protection to vast numbers of underprivileged human beings.
It also stresses the role of community health in the social and economic development and may be recommended as a companion volume to the recent Pearson Report (Lester B. {PEARSON} (Chairman). Partners in Development. Report of the Commission on International Development, 1969. London: Pall Mall Press). This voluminous report dealt with various aspects of aid for tropical countries. It concentrated mainly on economic aspects of development and underestimated the role of health of the community, drawing some adverse comments from the public health experts (Lancet, 197Q, v. 1, L.

A limited number of recent studies suggest that {SEP} may itself play a role in the epidemiology of disease and death associated with exposure to air pollution. Together with evidence that poor and working-class communities are often more exposed to air pollution, these studies have stimulated discussion among scientists, policy makers, and the public about the differential distribution of the health impacts from air pollution. Science and public policy would benefit from additional research that integrates the theory and practice from both air pollution and social epidemiologies to gain a better understanding of this issue. In this article we aim to promote such research by introducing readers to methodologic and conceptual approaches in the fields of air pollution and social epidemiology; by proposing theories and hypotheses about how air pollution and socioeconomic factors may interact to influence health, drawing on studies conducted worldwide; by discussing methodologic issues in the design and analysis of studies to determine whether health effects of exposure to ambient air pollution are modified by {SEP}; and by proposing specific steps that will advance knowledge in this field, fill information gaps, and apply research results to improve public health in collaboration with affected communities.},

	abstract = {Background
Health researchers rarely measure accumulated wealth to reflect socioeconomic status/position ({SES}). In order to determine whether health research should more frequently include measures of wealth, this study assessed the relationship between wealth and health.
Methods
Studies published between 1990 to 2006 were systematically reviewed. Included studies used wealth and at least one other {SES} measure as independent variables, and a health-related dependent variable.
Results
Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Measures of wealth varied greatly. In most studies, greater wealth was associated with better health, even after adjusting for other {SES} measures. The findings appeared most consistent when using detailed wealth measures on specific assets and debts, rather than a single question. Adjusting for wealth generally decreased observed racial/ethnic disparities in health.
Conclusions
Health studies should include wealth as an important {SES} indicator. Failure to measure wealth may result in under-estimating the contribution of {SES} to health, such as when studying the etiology of racial/ethnic disparities. Validation is needed for simpler approaches to measuring wealth that would be feasible in health studies.},

The fewer goods and services are provided publicly by the community, the more important individual income is for health.

We then apply the framework to past and prospective reductions in mortality risks, both overall and for specific life-threatening diseases. We calculate (i) the social values of increased longevity for men and women over the 20th century; (ii) the social value of progress against various diseases after 1970; and (iii) the social value of potential future progress against various major categories of disease. The historical gains from increased longevity have been enormous. Over the 20th century, cumulative gains in life expectancy were worth over \$1.2 million per person for both men and women. Between 1970 and 2000 increased longevity added about \$3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, an uncounted value equal to about half of average annual {GDP} over the period. Reduced mortality from heart disease alone has increased the value of life by about \$1.5 trillion per year since 1970. The potential gains from future innovations in health care are also extremely large. Even a modest 1 percent reduction in cancer mortality would be worth nearly \$500 billion.},

	abstract = {Building on the social science literature, we hypothesized that population health indicators in wealthy industrialized countries are ‘clustered’ around welfare state regime types. We tested this hypothesis during a period of welfare state expansion from 1960 to 1994. We categorized data from 19 wealthy countries into 4 different types of welfare state regimes (Social Democratic, Christian Democratic, Liberal and Wage Earner Welfare States). Outcome variables were the infant mortality rate ({IMR}) and the low birth weight rate ({LBW}), obtained from the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development ({OECD}) Health Data 2000 and from the United Nations Common Statistical Database ({UNCSD}). A two-level multilevel model was constructed, and fixed effects of welfare state were tested. Through the 39 years analyzed, Social Democratic countries exhibited a significantly better population health status, i.e., lower infant mortality rate and low birth weight rate, compared to other countries. Twenty percent of the difference in infant mortality rate among countries could be explained by the type of welfare state, and about 10\% for low birth weight rate. The gap between Social Democracies and other countries widened over the 1990s. Our results confirm that countries exhibit distinctive levels of population health by welfare regime types even when adjusted by the level of economic development ({GDP} per capita) and intra-country correlations. It implies that countries, as groups, adopt similar policies or through any other ways, achieve similar level of health status. Proposed mechanisms of such process and suggestions for future research directions are presented in the discussion.},

	abstract = {This timely volume describes the emergence of a crisis in world mental health. It analyzes the growing burden of mental, behavioral and social problems in low-income countries, examines the sources of the substantial morbidity rates and their relation to development, and assesses current efforts to cope with them. It identifies opportunities for effective mental health interventions, methods of treatment, culturally appropriate prevention programs, and sound policy formation. It relates the mental health consequences of violence, dislocation, poverty, and the disenfranchisement of women to the most pressing economic, political, and environmental problems of our time. Because many of the problems reviewed in this volume occur in both low-income and high-income societies, fruitful comparison and collaboration between North and South can lead to mental health policies that can be applied in many settings.},
